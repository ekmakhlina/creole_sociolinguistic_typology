59,,59,Sango,"Sango is the national language of the Central African Republic and co-official with French. It is certainly the vernacular (the most common language of every-day use) of Bangui, the nation’s capital, with more than half a million inhabitants. In 1994 69 per cent of pre-school children of different ethnicities spoke only Sango; among school children 10 to 16 years of age 31 per cent were similarly Sangophone. For Protestant adults, the figure was 26 per cent. Sango is probably spoken by most of Central African Republic’s indigenous population out of a total number of three to four million. The number of people not competent in Sango has probably increased in recent years as people fled social and political upheavals in neighbouring Chad and Sudan, the most recent one being the Islamist invasion and conquest in April 2013. As a vernacular, it is more important than French, which is the written language, even in popular political discourse. Sango literature is entirely religious. Though there are radio broadcasts in Sango, much of them extemporaneous translations of French texts, this must be considered a separate lect because of its extreme francification. The default lect used for this project is characteristic of young inhabitants in Bangui in the 1990s as found in tape recordings of extemporaneous speech. Another lect, which I call written, is extemporaneous speech with a
great deal of French. This lect is also used in the Sango of personal letters and in publications of religious literature.Plans three decades ago for the standardization of Sango and its implementation in the educational system came to nought very quickly. For the future, the most certain prediction is that Sango will continue to change under the influence of ‘broken French.’

1,,1,Early Sranan,"Over the years multiple historical documents in and on the English-base creole language of Suriname known as Sranan or Sranantongo have been uncovered, resulting in a substantial digitized corpus of eighteenth-century texts. These texts, stored in the Suriname Creole Archive at the Radboud University, Nijmegen, provide a unique window on the Sranan language as it was spoken in the eighteenth century, that is, at earlier stages of its development. In several historical sources phonological, grammatical, semantic, and pragmatic differences between varieties of the creole language are acknowledged, and some varieties appear to have been so different that they are known under distinct names. For example, in Schumann’s Sranan–German dictionary of 1783, we find references to Plantasi tongo (Plantation language), Foto tongo (City language), Ningre tongo (Black’s language) as well as English tongo (English language). Early Sranan is used as cover term for these 18th century creole varieties. Detailed comparisons of the historical creole data with their equivalents in contemporary varieties of Sranantongo and the Surinamese Maroon languages have further refined our understanding of language variation and language change in Early Sranan.  The default lect documented in APiCS is the variety of Early Sranan that was used for interethnic out-group communication. When available, examples of diachronic, social, stylistic and geographical variation are included.","Over the years multiple historical documents in and on the English-base creole language of Suriname known as Sranan or Sranantongo have been uncovered, resulting in a substantial digitized corpus of eighteenth-century texts.

2,,2,Sranan,"Sranan, also known as Sranan Tongo, Taki-Taki, and Suriname Creole English, is used as the lingua franca of Suriname, and is one of 20 languages spoken in that country, among which are six other creoles. Sranan is spoken both as a first language and a lingua franca throughout the country and in western French Guiana. It is currently the native language of about 126,000 Surinamese, and a second (or third) language for most of the rest of the population of about 400,000. It is also estimated that most of the 200,000 people of Surinamese descent who now live in the Netherlands also speak Sranan. The varieties used by speakers there as well as by Dutch-dominant Surinamese have been influenced to varying degrees by Dutch. The varieties used by groups of Asian descent as well as by Amerindians also appear to have been influenced by the respective ethnic languages, though little research has been done to investigate such influences. There is also a great deal of variation in the language according to social class and status. In general, two primary varieties can be identified. One is the more conservative variety learnt as a first language by members of the working classes in poorer neighborhoods in Paramaribo, as well as in former plantation areas such as the Para District, Coronie, etc. These speakers are for the most part Afro-Surinamese, and refer to their vernacular as “Nengre” (Black Talk). This is the default lect selected for APiCS. The other main variety of Sranan has been more heavily influenced by Dutch since it is mostly used as second language by Dutch-dominant speakers, and is referred to as Dutch-influenced.","Sranan, also known as Sranan Tongo, Taki-Taki, and Suriname Creole English, is used as the lingua franca of Suriname, and is one of 20 languages spoken in that country, among which are six other creoles.

3,,3,Saramaccan,"Saramaccan is one of the maroon creole languages of Surinam. It is spoken by the Saramaccan and Matawai tribes. The sociolinguistic situation of Saramaccan at the present is unclear, as a significant part of the population has moved away from the original maroon settlements on the Suriname River to the following three main locations for different reasons: Paramaribo, the capital of Surinam, for reasons of employment, and as a refuge from the civil war; French Guiana also as a refuge because of the war; and the Netherlands as an emigrant destination. The total number of speakers (in Surinam and in the diaspora) has been estimated as up to 50.000. Little detailed work has been done on internal variation in Saramaccan. Upriver (líbase) and downriver (básuse) dialects can be distinguished, as well as a separate Matawai dialect spoken on the Saramacca River.

4,,4,Nengee,"The different varieties of Nengee (Aluku, Ndyuka and Pamaka) emerged during the 18th century as the result of maroonage. Although they ultimately have their origin in the contact varieties that emerged on the plantation of Suriname, they developed into distinct varieties, having undergone separate development after their founders’ settlement in the interior of the Surinamese/French Guianese rainforst. There has always been some contact between Maroons and the coastal population through Maroon men’s commercial activities and seasonal cash labor. However, contact has gradually intensified since the 1950s with Maroons’ greater integration into Surinamese and recently also French Guianese society due to both migration and, to a much lesser extent, social change in the village setting. Today, both many Maroon men and women live in or regularly spend time in urban contexts and are in contact with members of other Maroon communities and non-Maroons. In this new context, code alternation practices involving the regional lingua franca Sranan (also Sranantongo), but also other languages such as Dutch and to a lesser extent French and English have become quite frequent in both out-group and in-group speech among younger people and new social varieties (e.g. wakaman/yunkuman tongo) have emerged besides other existing ones such as respect speech (cf. Migge 2004). In addition, non-Maroons in French Guiana have been acquiring these newly emerging multilingual practices often referred to as Takitaki locally (Cf. Migge & van den Berg 2009; Migge & Léglise 2011, 2013; Léglise & Migge 2007). The description of linguistics features in APiCS (default lect) are predominantly based on typical monolingual everyday speech that is associated with the village context (Huttar & Huttar 1994; Goury & Migge 2003; and other articles by these authors).

5,,5,Creolese,"Creolese, also referred to in the literature as Guyanese Creole, is a widely-used vernacular language variety which co-exists with Standard Guyanese English, the sole official language of the Republic of Guyana, which is normally acquired through formal schooling. It is the native tongue of the majority of the over 700, 000 inhabitants of the Republic of Guyana, and also widely spoken by several hundred thousand other Guyanese, scattered in the diaspora communities worldwide. Contributing languages to Creolese have included English, Arawak (Lokono), Carib (Karina), Bhojpuri, Akan, Kikongo, Yoruba and Dutch. Due to an ever-present, ongoing contact with its major contributing lexifier English, the Creolese language variety has developed a high degree of variability. Linguists such as Bickerton (1975) and Rickford (1979, 1987) and other scholars have used the term “Creole continuum” to describe this language variety. This continuum includes at one end of the spectrum a basilectal or more conservative language variety and on the other end an acrolectal language variety, more closely allied to Standard English, with a mesolectal or an infinite number of varieties existing in between. In order to provide the user with a more global understanding of the variation context within which Creolese speakers generally operate, the default lect for APiCS incorporates both basilectal and mesolectal varieties of the language. Published sources for some of the examples used in the Creolese APiCS dataset include Dolphin (1996), Monar (1985), Rickford (1979, 1987), Bickerton (1975), Devonish (1974) and Persaud (1970).","Creolese, also referred to in the literature as Guyanese Creole, is a widely-used vernacular language variety which co-exists with Standard Guyanese English, the sole official language of the Republic of Guyana, which is normally acquired through formal schooling.

It is the de facto language of national identity in Trinidad and is used in functional distribution with the official language English. Trinidad English Creole serves as means of informal communication across all ethnic and socio-economic groups. Its functional domain restrictions have decreased in the last decades: in 1975, the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Education recognized Trinidad English Creole as a legitimate vehicle for oral and written expression in schools and educators were encouraged to use teaching strategies based on the differences between Trinidad English Creole and standard English.  Trinidad English Creole use can also be found increasingly in the media (radio, television). Some formerly stigmatized features of Trinidad English Creole have now become accepted acrolectal use.

8,,8,Jamaican,"Jamaican (Creole), also called (Jamaican) Patwa is spoken by the majority of Jamaica's 2.7 million inhabitants, in addition to hundreds of thousands of Jamaicans or people of Jamaican descent in diaspora communities, especially in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Although the language has had a long history of writing, writing was mainly done in the past by professional writers, especially in the field of literature. The internet and social media have drastically increased the number of ordinary persons who are now writing Jamaican. There is an official writing system (Cassidy-JLU orthography) for the language, but it is mostly used by linguists and a few other language enthusiasts. The ordinary folk continue to use an English etymological style to represent the language in writing. There is some local programming on radio and television in Jamaican and many advertisements across various media make extensive use of Jamaican. The language has several descriptions of its syntax and phonology (e.g. Bailey 1966, Akers (1981), Patrick 2007, Durrleman-Tame 2008), a dictionary (Cassidy & Le Page 1967/1980) and a recent translation of the New Testament done by the Bible Society of the West Indies (2012). 

The default lect documented in APiCS Online is commonly referred to as basilectal Jamaican. Basilectal Jamaican is characterized by the categorical use of preverbal markers to express tense, mood, and aspect. Since most of the examples reflect my (Joseph T. Farquharson) native speaker competence, they represent a western dialect of Jamaican that is not often referenced in the linguistics literature. The distinguishing features of this variety is the use of wehn as anterior marker where eastern varieties use en, or min (highly restricted), and the use of de as progressive aspect marker where  non-western dialects use a. It is assumed that most of the features of the western basilectal variety of Jamaican captured in APiCS Online are the same as or very close to basilectal varieties islandwide. Mesolectal Jamaican, the only other lect identified in the APiCS database is characterized by the use of preverbal did as anterior marker, the suffix -in to mark progressive aspect, and the variable occurrence of the -s suffix to mark plural, sometimes along with the prototypical basilectal marker dem (e.g. di gorlz [dem] 'the girls').","Jamaican (Creole), also called (Jamaican) Patwa is spoken by the majority of Jamaica's 2.7 million inhabitants, in addition to hundreds of thousands of Jamaicans or people of Jamaican descent in diaspora communities, especially in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

9,,9,Belizean Creole,"Belizean Creole (English-based) is used natively by members of the ethnic Creole group and fluently as a lingua franca (as well as sometimes natively) by most of the remaining ethnically diverse population of Belize (including Garinagu, Mestizo and Maya/Kekchi people).  It is also likely to be spoken by at least some of the older emigrants of the Belizean diaspora in the United States, albeit only in intragroup contexts. The data represented in APiCS (default lect) were all produced in the majority Creole districts of Belize by native speakers in spontaneous contexts, but there was no attempt at documenting the creole varieties used by the diaspora.  Practically all speakers of Belizean Creole shift constantly and seamlessly into mesolects and acrolects across the language spectrum, as determined by elements of the social context (speaker status, style, setting, sex of speaker or audience, etc.), and it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a given feature is basilectal or other. I have sometimes assumed in APiCS discussions of specific features that mesolectal and even acrolectal features have in fact been integrated into the basilect, a normal process of language change which can be readily observed in many language situations representative of the creole continuum.","Belizean Creole (English-based) is used natively by members of the ethnic Creole group and fluently as a lingua franca (as well as sometimes natively) by most of the remaining ethnically diverse population of Belize (including Garinagu, Mestizo and Maya/Kekchi people).

Practically all speakers of Belizean Creole shift constantly and seamlessly into mesolects and acrolects across the language spectrum, as determined by elements of the social context (speaker status, style, setting, sex of speaker or audience, etc.), and it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a given feature is basilectal or other. I have sometimes assumed in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS </span>discussions of specific features that mesolectal and even acrolectal features have in fact been integrated into the basilect, a normal process of language change which can be readily observed in many language situations representative of the creole continuum.",,1
10,,10,San Andres Creole English,"San Andres Creole English is spoken in the archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina, Colombia, by no more but possibly considerably fewer than 20,000 speakers. The language is also spoken by diaspora communities located, most importantly, in mainland Colombia and, in second place, on the Central American Caribbean Coast, especially in Panama, and in the United States. The numbers of speakers and the extent to which the language is maintained in the diaspora is not known.

The two main varieties of the language are San Andres Creole proper (or Saintandrewan, as language activists call it) and Providence Creole English. At first sight, the distinguishing criterion appears to be geographical. However, we are dealing with structurally distinct varieties, and I believe that sociolectal variation in terms of a hypothetical creole continuum constitutes an even more important criterion: Providence Creole English is clearly a more acrolectal variety of Western Caribbean Creole English than San Andres Creole English. Unless otherwise specified, basilectal San Andres Creole English, i.e., the creole of the island of San Andres, constitutes the default lect described here. Occasionally, reference is being made to Providence Creole English and a written lect ocurring in the very few teaching materials devised for San Andres Creole English.

San Andres Creole English constitutes a minority as well as a minorized language on the island. Over the past fifteen years, the little presence it had in the media has faded away and efforts by the Colombian Ministry of Education to start a nation-wide move towards bilingual education in Spanish and (Standard) English in San Andres and Providence further jeopardizes the timid pro-creole action taken since the 1980s and especially during the 1990s. Providence Creole English speakers never really embraced the idea of their creole being an autonomous variety, let alone a distinct language. I consider both San Andres and Providence Creole English to be more or less highly endangered.","San Andres Creole English is spoken in the archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina, Colombia, by no more but possibly considerably fewer than 20,000 speakers.

11,,11,Nicaraguan Creole English,"Nicaraguan Creole English (or Miskito Coast Creole English) is spoken as a first language by several groups of people: ethnic Creoles, the Rama, Nicaraguan Garifuna, and some Miskitos, and as a second language by other Miskitos and some Mestizos. It is mainly spoken (nowadays as a minority language) in the two Nicaraguan Autonomous Regions of the Atlantic Coast but also elsewhere in Nicaragua, the United States, and other small diaspora communities. Estimates of speaker numbers vary between 35,000 and 50,000.

Nicaraguan Creole English can be considered one of the oldest English-based varieties in the Americas. Belizean Creole constitutes a direct off-shoot of Nicaraguan Creole English which, on the other hand, has undergone influence from several other Western Caribbean Creoles, obscuring the genetic relationships of the creoles of the region in question.

Speakers themselves identify at least the variants of Bluefields, the Corn Islands, Pearl Lagoon, Rama Cay, Orinoco, and Bilwi. It is commonly felt that the urban variety of Bluefields should constitute the basis for standardization. On the other hand, Spanish is much more present in Bluefields than in rural communities. Over recent years, there have been signs that the Spanish–Creole English diglossia has started to leak. Nevertheless, it has been postulated that there continue to exist separate Anglo, ""costeño"" (coastal) and Black identities within the Creole population and those most closely identifying with the Anglo identity are unlikely to be in favor of bilingual Creole-Spanish programs any more than they were in the 1980s. Indeed, Standard English is valued not only as an international language but also as the foundation of that particular facet of Creole identity as a cross of a class and an ethnic position. 

The default lect in APiCS is constituted by data gathered in Bluefields and surrounding locations in 2006-2007. It appears quite clear that Nicaraguan Creole English constitutes a genuine instance of decreolization when compared to materials collected in the early 1970s.

There is a small diaspora elsewhere in Florida and in Texas. Gullah is in a continuum relation with surrounding varieties of American English. It is not part of any official census and functions primarily in a close-knit community so that it is difficult to come up with precise speaker numbers.

On one end, the lectal continuum of Pichi features a variety rather close to Sierra Leone Krio in terms of phonology, morphosyntax, lexicon and idiomatic usage. This variety tends to be characteristic of older speakers, who grew up in the centre of Malabo in the ambit of Fernandino creole culture. On the other end, we find a variety characterized by phonological and morphosyntactic innovation, the absence of older layers of Krio-derived vocabulary, some convergence with West African English lexifier creoles like Nigerian Pidgin, and considerable lexical and structural admixture from Spanish. This variety, which is the default lect documented in APiCS, tends to be spoken by the younger urban working-class population of Malabo, often with a Bubi cultural background, who have adopted Pichi as a primary language, and whose families have been accultured in more recent decades into the Pichi-speaking urban culture of Malabo.

22,,22,Tok Pisin,"Tok Pisin is an English-lexified pidgin/creole spoken in Papua New Guinea which has developed over the past 150 years or so. Sister dialects are spoken in neighbouring countries: Solomons Pijin in the Solomon Islands and Bislama in Vanuatu. The number of speakers of the language is difficult to determine accurately (as is the population of the country), but it is estimated that at least half of the approximately 6 million people of Papua New Guinea have at least a working knowledge of the language. The term Tok Pisin covers a wide range of both second and first language varieties, including some that are heavily influenced by English - especially in urban areas – or by indigenous languages. Nationally, Tok Pisin is predominantly spoken as a language in addition to either indigenous languages or English, and so bilingual effects in spoken language are commonplace. 

For many years Tok Pisin was spoken almost exclusively as a second language and used for a limited range of functions in this intensely multilingual area. In the past few decades, the number of speakers of creolized first language Tok Pisin has been rising steadily. Geoff Smith's own research was based on a corpus of transcribed speech of adolescents who spoke Tok Pisin as their first language, and this is the default lect used for judgements in APiCS. However, it should be noted that within this corpus there are significant regional differences. Most of the published accounts of Tok Pisin are based on rural second language Tok Pisin, and much of the early work referred to the Madang area of north-east New Guinea. These sources have also occasionally been used for illustrative purposes.

Varieties of Tok Pisin are regularly used in radio and television broadcasts, in government and NGO communications and in commercial advertising as well as in the weekly published Wantok newspaper. While the spoken language of children and adults is generally as represented here, formal and informal written varieties can show considerable differences both in the regularity of grammar and in the admixture of English from this default lect.","Tok Pisin is an English-lexified pidgin/creole spoken in Papua New Guinea which has developed over the past 150 years or so.

Norf’k is not a standardized language and there is a great deal of variation. Family differences play an important part and, although the island occupies fewer than 40 square kilometres there are some regional differences between Cascade, Steels Point and Anson Bay varieties.
The principal differences, however, are determined by the proximity of the language to English. Speakers of the older generation (50+) grew up in a stable diglossic situation. For most speakers under 50 the domains and functions of English and Norf’k are no longer clearly separated and traditional Broad Norf’k is increasingly replaced by a more anglicized Norf’k.

Like other English-lexified creole languages of the Pacific, Kriol originates in the English-based pidgin used between the first colonizers and the indigenous inhabitants of the Sydney area, which subsequently spread inland and north. Many authors assume that creolization occurred abruptly early in the 20th century at an Anglican mission at Roper River (close to the present-day Ngukurr) through children from different language backgrounds who had been brought together in dormitories; for this reason Kriol is often referred to as Roper River Kriol. There is however evidence that the pidgin had already stabilized and linguistically expanded at that time, due to the need for communication between the increasing numbers of Aboriginal people working on cattle stations, the (primarily) English-speaking pastoralists, and the non-English-speaking (e.g. Chinese) colonists in a wider area.

33,,33,Guinea-Bissau Kriyol,"Guinea-Bissau Kriyol is a creole language lexically based on Portuguese which is spoken by over half the population of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, which totaled 1,520,830 people in 2009.  The creole is normally used in urban areas and in commerce in rural areas, where local languages predominate.  There is a triglossic situation in which Guinea-Bissau Kriyol occupies the middle position in a pyramid between Portuguese at the top with fewer speakers but with more prestige, and with the African languages at the bottom with the greatest total number of speakers but with the least prestige. Researchers such as Alain Kihm and Jean-Louis Rougé agree that Guinea-Bissau Kriyol has regional varieties, the main ones being that of Cacheu and São Domingos in the north, that of Bissau and Bolama in the center and that of Bafatá and Geba in the east. The variety spoken in Cacheu and São Domingos seems to be the most conservative, maintaining structural features today found in the variety spoken in Casamance in Senegal (which lost contact with the superstrate in the nineteenth century; Casamancese Creole is treated as a separate APiCS language).  The variety of Bissau and Bolama is the most progressive (having remained in contact with the superstrate as well as its substrate languages). Guinea-Bissau Kriyol was essentially an oral language but written texts gradually began to appear as vehicles of literature, science and religion. It is used in news programs on radio and television, in business, in daily life, and in churches and mosques. Beyond the regional varieties mentioned above, there are others varieties that have developed due to the influence of specific African languages or which reflect an individual speaker’s level of education. The variety which we have described in APiCS (default lect) is that used by speakers with a higher level of education. It is the variety used by teachers and students and it shares many more similarities with Portuguese than do the basilectal varieties spoken by people with little education. It is the variety most often heard in Bissau and the other major urban centers, characterized by Portuguese rules of agreement between elements in the noun phrase and by conjugated forms of certain frequent verb s such as ser ‘to be (permanently)’, estar ‘to be (temporarily)’, or ter ‘to have’.","Guinea-Bissau Kriyol is a creole language lexically based on Portuguese which is spoken by over half the population of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, which totaled 1,520,830 people in 2009.

There is a triglossic situation in which Guinea-Bissau Kriyol occupies the middle position in a pyramid between Portuguese at the top with fewer speakers but with more prestige, and with the African languages at the bottom with the greatest total number of speakers but with the least prestige. Researchers such as Alain Kihm and Jean-Louis Rougé agree that Guinea-Bissau Kriyol has regional varieties, the main ones being that of Cacheu and São Domingos in the north, that of Bissau and Bolama in the center and that of Bafatá and Geba in the east. The variety spoken in Cacheu and São Domingos seems to be the most conservative, maintaining structural features today found in the variety spoken in Casamance in Senegal (which lost contact with the superstrate in the nineteenth century; Casamancese Creole is treated as a separate <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span> language).  The variety of Bissau and Bolama is the most progressive (having remained in contact with the superstrate as well as its substrate languages). Guinea-Bissau Kriyol was essentially an oral language but written texts gradually began to appear as vehicles of literature, science and religion. It is used in news programs on radio and television, in business, in daily life, and in churches and mosques. Beyond the regional varieties mentioned above, there are others varieties that have developed due to the influence of specific African languages or which reflect an individual speaker’s level of education. The variety which we have described in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span> (default lect) is that used by speakers with a higher level of education. It is the variety used by teachers and students and it shares many more similarities with Portuguese than do the basilectal varieties spoken by people with little education.

34,,34,Casamancese Creole,"Casamancese Creole is the mother tongue of about 10,000 people living in or around the Senegalese city of Ziguinchor (Basse-Casamance, Southern Senegal). It is also spoken with various degrees of proficiency by several tens of thousands of second language speakers living in the same region. The language seems to be quite homogeneous. However, language variation exists and seems to be linked with several factors. First, there is a contrast between urban Casamancese (spoken in Ziguinchor), more exposed to the influence of Wolof, French and Guinea-Bissau Kriyol vs. rural Casamancese, generally more conservative and also more influenced by several local adstrates (mostly Ñun, Joola, and Mandinka). Second, there are differences between native and non-native varieties of Casamancese Creole. In the Casamancese-speaking sections of Ziguinchor and in some neighbouring villages (e.g. Sindone), Casamancese is spoken by many people as a first language whereas in other villages (e.g. Djifanghor), Casamancese is used on a daily basis but as a second language alongside with a native language (e.g. a local variety of Ñun in Djifanghor). As regards Djifanghor (and this surely applies to other bilingual communities), the Casamancese spoken by Ñun-speakers, although being very similar to native Casamancese, displays some idiosyncratic developments, e.g. it allows analogical synthetic causatives for mas ‘more’ > masintí ‘surpass, have a bigger share than’ or bas ‘underneath’ > basintí ‘surpass, be better than’, which are refused by native Casamancese speakers. Third, together with urban vs. rural and first vs. second language, there also exists diatopic variation (e.g. the word for ‘cloud’ is nuybu in some villages and nirbu/nírbu/nibu in other places). Unless otherwise specified, the default lect illustrated in APiCS is the variety of Casamancese Creole spoken in the village of Sindone (some 30 km East of Ziguinchor). This rural variety is the native lect of Noël Bernard Biagui, who co-authored this contribution and it is today the main vernacular (and also the first vehicular) language in Sindone.

35,,35,Santome,"Santome is a Portuguese-related creole language spoken primarily on the island of S. Tomé in the Democratic Republic of S. Tomé e Príncipe by some 60.000 people (2012), which corresponds roughly to one third of its population, and by an unknown number of speakers in the diaspora (e.g. Portugal and Angola). Compared to previous censuses (1991, 2001), the number of speakers appears to be dropping quickly, which is related to the ongoing shift to Portuguese, the official language. In fact, monolingual speakers of Santome are nowadays hard to find. As a non-official language, Santome is essentially an informally used spoken language that is growingly confined from a geographical, generational and functional perspective, which means it is more likely to find fluent speakers in non-urban settings and among older generations. Music is the one of the few domains where the language is still thriving. The data used in APiCS (default lect) were generally drawn from transcriptions of mostly 40 to 80 year old native speakers from different non-urban areas of S. Tomé who were recorded in 1997 and 2001. A few written sources were used as well. Whenever necessary, the data for the atlas were double-checked or elicited with the help of other native speakers. The speech varieties of the recorded L1 speakers and the consultants are relatively homogeneous but should be seen within a wider picture of L1/L2 variation, language attrition and change.","Santome is a Portuguese-related creole language spoken primarily on the island of S.

36,,36,Angolar,"The Portuguese-based language Angolar is spoken by approximatively 5,000 people in the southwestern and the southeastern part of the island of São Tomé in the Gulf of Guinea. It is a maroon creole, that is, a creole that was spoken by slaves who escaped from slavery and rebuilt their own society in regions where they were free from the slave owners. Some Angolar speakers also live on Principe Island as well as in Portugal, especially in Lisbon.

It is not clear whether the language is still being passed on to the newer generations; the pressure from Santome, the other creole language spoken on the island, and from Portuguese is very strong.

Though Angolar is not mutually intelligible with Santome, it is closely related to and most probably derived from it (as the other two creole languages of the Gulf of Guinea, Principense and Fa d’Ambô). What characterizes Angolar is that an important part of its vocabulary is of Bantu, especially of Kimbundu origin. Note, however, that this influence concerns mostly the lexicon and not the morphosyntax of the language.

The default lect chosen for APiCS is the variety of speakers who at the time of my main fieldwork (in the early 1990s) were 50 years or older.","The Portuguese-based language Angolar is spoken by approximatively 5,000 people in the southwestern and the southeastern part of the island of São Tomé in the Gulf of Guinea.

37,,37,Principense,"Principense, a Portuguese-based language called Lung’Ie (the language of the island) by its speakers, is an endangered language. On the island of Principe (Gulf of Guinea), there are maybe still twenty native speakers who speak the language fluently; however, a teritorially homogeneous linguistic community does not exist any more. The dominant languages of Principe are regional varieties of Portuguese as well as Cape Verdean Creole; the latter is spoken by more than half of the population of the island, due to the important immigration of Cape Verdeans from the beginning of the 20th century.

Some efforts have been made to teach Principense in school, but these efforts have not been successful. Printed media do not exist on the island of Principe, but radio news are broadcast five times a week (sometimes less).

Outside Principe, Principense is spoken on the neighbouring island São Tomé; a fairly numerous community of Principense speakers live in Lisbon (Portugal); however, it is impossible to determine the exact number of these native speakers.

The other lect which is dealt with in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span>, called <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Batavia Creole (Tugu)</span>, refers to Tugu Creole, which is an offshoot of Batavia Creole brought during the 1660 to Batavia’s hinterland by about 150 members of Batavia’s Portuguese community which were slaves who were freed and who were given land because they converted from Catholicism to Calvinism. Nowadays, the small village of Tugu is a neighbourhood of North Jakarta called Kampung Tugu. Tugu Creole became obsolete in the first half of the twentieth century. This Portuguese creole variety is characterized by a strong influence from spoken Malay at all levels of its grammar, an influence which is not that strong in Batavia Creole.",,1
44,,44,Ternate Chabacano,"Ternate Chabacano is spoken by some 3,000 people in the town of Ternate, Cavite province, Philippines. It is one of the Spanish contact varieties that are spoken in the Philippines and known collectively as Chabacano. There are also some diaspora speakers in the United States and other migrant worker destinations. Chabacano is a minority language in the town associated with the traditional local community. All the Chabacano speakers in Ternate are multilingual in Chabacano and Tagalog, as well as other languages. Trends in existing domains can be characterized as multilingualism with dwindling domains: Tagalog and English dominate in many communication contexts. Spanish is no longer commonly spoken in Ternate. Chabacano is mainly used at home and in the neighbourhoods together with Tagalog. Chabacano is not part of the school curriculum in Ternate, but some teachers of the first grades use Chabacano unofficially. Ternate Chabacano is a spoken variety and it is rather difficult to find written samples in printed media, but personal letters and new media are one domain where the written form of the language can be found. Chabacano is written in different ways by different age groups. The default lect chosen for description in APiCS is the speech of older Ternateños living in the central barangays or neighbourhoods of Ternate. The language of the younger speakers of Chabacano has especially been influenced by English and Tagalog. Examples are from a spoken language corpus collected in Ternate between 2003 and 2006.

46,,46,Zamboanga Chabacano,"Zamboanga Chabacano (Zamboangueño) is a Spanish-based creole language spoken by around 450,000 people in the Republic of the Philippines in South-East Asia, and by an unknown number of diaspora speakers in Malaysia (Province of Sabah), the United States of America, Canada and elsewhere. Chabacano is the native language of about 50 per cent of the population of the city of Zamboanga and the surrounding area in the extreme western part of the island of Mindanao (approximately 300,000 speakers). A subvariety of Zamboanga Chabacano is also spoken in the town of Cotabato (Mindanao). The creole is also used here as a lingua franca by diverse ethno-linguistic groups. It is codified for public and private purposes with a Hispanic orthography mixed with English and Philippine traditions; there are Bible translations, literary writings, and until recently also press publications. Public oral use has recently been increasing in broadcasting and television, in church, and in some public schools. It lost some of its former significance to Philippine languages (Tagalog and Cebuano) and English.

The default lect that we chose for description in APiCS is roughly the speech of 20-40 year old people living in city of Zamboanga. Nearly all constructed examples are from different native speakers instructed for fieldwork on Chabacano at the Ateneo of Zamboanga.

47,,47,Papiamentu,"Papiamentu is the first language of more than 70% of the populations of the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao), and has communities of speakers also in the Netherlands, St. Maarten, and elsewhere. It has official language status in Aruba since 2003, alongside Dutch. In the Netherlands Antilles, Papiamentu is an official language since 2007, alongside Dutch and English. With the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, the official status of Papiamentu was maintained.
Although speakers insist that there are significant differences between the varieties of Aruba and Curaçao, work on these varieties has only established minor differences. Similar claims have been made by urban Curaçaoan speakers about more rural varieties, but there is really no evidence to suggest that mutual intelligibility is in any way compromised.
Where there is a significant difference is in the spelling conventions adopted in the different islands: where Aruba opted to use an etymological spelling method, Curaçao and Bonaire adopted the phonemic system developed by the late Raul Römer. As a result, texts produced in the different islands are visually very different and easily give an impression of unintelligibility. In this description of Papiamentu, the orthography of examples has been normalized to Römer’s phonemic spelling system regardless of their original spelling. Unless an explicit indication is given of the island-origin of the data, examples and their discussion are to be interpreted to represent Papiamentu as spoken in any of the ABC islands.","Papiamentu is the first language of more than 70% of the populations of the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao), and has communities of speakers also in the Netherlands, St. Maarten, and elsewhere.

54,,54,Reunion Creole,"Reunion Creole is a French-based creole language spoken by about 90 percent of a population of more than 800,000 people on Reunion Island, a French Overseas Department, and by a considerable number of diaspora speakers in metropolitan France. Most speakers are bilingual in Creole and French, although some of them are ‘passive bilinguals’ who understand French, but only have a limited active command. The traditional situation of diglossia with Creole as the ‘low variety’ is gradually changing towards a “bilinguisme français–créole harmonieux”. Creole has been used by poets and novelists since the nineteenth century; in 2000 it gained official recognition as a regional language, and in 2002 it found its place in education as an optional subject in secondary schools. Reunion Creole is unique among French-based creoles in forming a continuum from basilect to acrolect, with intermediate fluctuating varieties. The default lect chosen for description in APiCS comprises basilectal varieties; variants from acrolectal varieties are occasionally mentioned. Data are taken from the Atlas linguistique et ethnographique de la Réunion (1984-1995), collected between 1975 and 1981 from mostly 40 to 80 year old speakers, as well as from recordings of extensive conversations and traditional stories made with some of the informants of the Atlas during field work.

48,,48,Palenquero,"Palenquero (“Lengua”) is used actively on a daily basis only in the village of Palenque (also known as San Basilio de Palenque), where it co-exists with Caribbean Spanish. Prior to its recent revival (around the year 2000), the creole was generally shunned by younger generations. Occasionally, Palenquero can also be heard in the nearby city of Cartagena, and the more distant Barranquilla, where about half of the total population of Palenqueros have been residing for many decades. To date, Palenquero remains a mostly oral language. Written Palenquero (used locally in school) has emerged during this millennium; agreed upon spelling conventions do not exist yet.

Traditionally, Palenquero tended to be confined to in-group situations, so much so that the language was generally not spoken in front of outsiders. Around the year 2000, changing local and regional attitudes began to reduce the heavy stigma once attached to Lengua, and as a result Palenqueros now feel far more comfortable speaking their local lect in front of outsiders (the recent fame of Palenque has generated a substantial amount of local academic tourism —both national and international—, which has greatly increased contact with the outside world).

As argued in Schwegler (2001), prior to the year 2000, in Palenque there used to be no apparent lectal differences (basilect, mesolect or acrolect). In this small speech community, old and young bilinguals employed a virtually identical creole grammar, that is, there was no continuum, no “in-between” in terms of lects. This situation appears to have changed since then, as some of the younger generations may be employing a somewhat restructured variety of the creole as their main lect. However, to date no extensive study of current Palenquero has been undertaken (but see Lipski 2012), and it remains to be seen whether the recent adaptations by Palenquero youths will stabilize and have a long-lasting effect. The Palenquero data collected for the APiCS (default lect) are all from the traditional (older) lect.","Palenquero (“Lengua”) is used actively on a daily basis only in the village of Palenque (also known as San Basilio de Palenque), where it co-exists with Caribbean Spanish.

It is difficult to estimate the precise number of speakers among Haitians living in diaspora communities, i.e. the about 2 million people that emigrated mainly to the USA, Canada (Québec), Dominican Republic and French Overseas territories (Lesser Antilles, Guiana). 

The Haitian Constitution of 1987 granted Haitian Creole the status of an official language next to French (official language since 1918). The language of the schools had long been exclusively in French, but opened up to Creole from 1979 onwards. In that year an official phonologically based orthography was implemented for Haitian Creole. In the following the Creole was used in an increasing number of domains and in the mass media (especially radio and internet).

53,,53,Louisiana Creole,"Louisiana Creole is an endangered French creole spoken by Blacks, Whites, and Creoles of Color in several disparate locations in south Louisiana. While no reliable figures exist, we estimate that there are today well under 10,000 speakers of the language; we are not aware of any remaining monolingual speakers. The most fluent speakers are generally elderly, and younger speakers often have gaps in their lexicon and practice frequent codeswitching between Creole and English. We have chosen as the default lect the variety spoken in and around the town of Breaux Bridge, first, because a detailed description of this variety exists (Neumann 1985), and second, because it is in this area that the largest concentration of Louisiana Creole speakers is to be found. The APiCS description of Louisiana Creole also includes two additional lects, identified as geographical (Pointe Coupee) and old texts. Geographical (Pointe Coupee) refers to the variety spoken in and around the town of New Roads in Pointe Coupee Parish as described in Klingler (2003), while old texts refers to the basilectal variety of the language that is represented in nineteenth-century texts such as those found in Neumann-Holzschuh (1987), our main source for this lect. Louisiana Creole co-exists with a regional variety of French (commonly called “Cajun French”) and, especially, English. Both languages have had profound effects on the way that Creole is spoken.

Louisiana Creole co-exists with a regional variety of French (commonly called “Cajun French”) and, especially, English. Both languages have had profound effects on the way that Creole is spoken. Borrowing and codeswitching are common, and it seems likely that contact with regional French is at least partly responsible for the differences that can be observed between the default lect described here and the more basilectal variety found in the old texts lect.",,1

56,,56,Seychelles Creole,"Seychelles Creole (autoglossonym: kreol (seselwa)) is a French-based creole language spoken by some 80,000 people in the Republic of the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean (east of Kenya), and by an unknown number of diaspora speakers in Kenya, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Since 1978 Seychelles Creole has been one of the three official languages besides English and French. Creole is the native language of about 95 per cent of the population. In 1982 it was introduced as a language of instruction in primary schools and has been used in different formal communication contexts, for example, in the media (television, radio, newspapers) and in court. But during the last 15 years, the use of written varieties of Seychelles Creole has lost much of its former significance to English.

Whether or not it is regarded as a creole depends on whether or not one associates creoles exclusively with European lexifiers in plantation settlement colonies. It was lexified by Kimanyanga, one of the languages in the Kikongo cluster. It dates from the late 19th or early 20th century, after the Belgian colonial administration of the then Congo Free State imported laborers speaking diverse Bantu languages from various parts of central Africa to build the railroad between the Atlantic coast and the capital city, Kinshasa (then called Léopoldville). It has also been associated with the colonial auxiliaries brought from West Africa by the Belgian administrators to serve as intermediaries and interpreters. Both the laborers and auxiliaries adopted Kimanyanga, which had served as a trade lingua franca from the Atlantic coast to the interior, for communication with the locals and among themselves, while they lived segregated from both the Europeans and the locals. The particular settings in which these populations were brought to co-exist were designated as ""centres extra-coutumiers"" ‘non-traditional centers’, the ancestors of present-day cities, associated with modern economic activities. As the colonial administration expanded into the interior, beyond the lower Congo River area, the restructured Kimanyanga spread with it. Functioning at first as a lingua franca, it evolved into an urban vernacular. Bearing influence from the various Bantu languages it came in contact with, it speciated into a new language. From these new urban centers, it spread as a regional lingua franca. Regarding regional variation, which does not impede mutual intelligibility, see Mufwene (1997).

60,,60,Lingala,"Lingala has its origins in a process of pidginization that took place in the early 1880s involving the Central African language Bobangi as main lexifier. In 1884, the resulting pidgin was taken to the colonial state post Bangala Station (today, Mankanza), where it underwent expanding influence from the local languages and where it received its first glossonym, “Bangala”. From the late 1880s onwards, the language spread from the station in north-eastward direction, as far as the Sudanese border, and in southward direction, as far as Léopoldville (now, Kinshasa). In each place, influence from local languages further expanded the language along independent trajectories. On top of this, in the first decade of the 20th century, missionaries working in the Bangala Station area (then renamed Nouvelle-Anvers) embarked on a vast project of prescriptive corpus planning, also suggesting the new glossonym “Lingala”. The engineered variant gained ground in the north-western region of the Belgian Congo, where the language as spoken today still very much resembles the way the missionaries designed it to be. But in Léopoldville its functions were restricted to church and school contexts, while for routine communication Bangala remained in use, following its own path of linguistic development (particularly marked by influence from Kikongo) and, in the first half of the 20th century, spilling over to Brazzaville. The new language name was more successful, soon receiving acceptance in Léopoldville, too. But in the north-eastern parts of the Congo, the old glossonym Bangala survived and, in fact, continues to be used until today. Since the late colonial and post-colonial eras, the variety spoken in the politically important and culturally vanguard capital Léopoldville -Kinshasa has been the most influential and popular one, encroaching on the varieties spoken in the north-west of the DR Congo, in the north-east, and in Brazzaville.

61,,61,Fanakalo,"The use of Fanakalo pidgin was one of the ways in which inter-ethnic communication was achieved in 19th Century South Africa, first among speakers of Zulu, Xhosa, English and Afrikaans in different contexts in the Eastern Cape and Natal.

Grammatical and lexical differences across the country are minor, though there is some phonetic variation according to speakers’ L1s.

64,,64,Juba Arabic,"Juba Arabic is an Arabic-based pidgincreole spoken in the Republic of South Sudan. At present, Juba Arabic is the major lingua franca of South Sudan as well as of large diaspora communities in Sudan, Egypt, the United States, and Australia. As Juba Arabic has many second- and third-language speakers, it is difficult to estimate the number of its speakers. Since 2005, Juba Arabic has been recognized as ""national language"", whereas English is the only ""official language"" of South Sudan. While it does not possess an established standard orthography, Juba Arabic is widely written in the Latin script. 

It is doubtful whether we can speak of a continuum in the case of Juba Arabic and its Sudanese Arabic lexifier. The prolonged coexistence of Juba Arabic with Sudanese Arabic has resulted in increasing structural affinity between this pidgincreole and its lexifier (labeled as ""Arabic interference"" in the data set). The structural effects of this contact situation vary a great deal according to sociolinguistic variables such as the speakers' residence and their degree of education. Urban speakers and people educated in Arabic generally speak acrolectal varieties, while rural and recently urbanized people tend to speak basilectal varieties. Polylectal variation may be entirely a matter of lexical switching (e.g. the basilectal/mesolectal ta/bita against the acrolectal ḥagg as possessive marker) or else may include variation affecting phonological rules as well (e.g. the absence of pharyngeal sounds in basilectal varieties against the integration of etymological [ʕ] and [ʔ] in acrolectal/mesolectal varieties). The default lect documented in APiCS is a mesolectal variety spoken by young and middle-aged English-educated male speakers born in Juba and displaced in Khartoum in the late 1990s.

This intergenerational decline in fluency is less evident in several smaller up-country (highland) communities. By contrast, the Malay residents of the southeastern coastal village of Kirinda, consisting of four hundred families, have thus far experienced no intergenerational decline whatsoever, and are effectively SLM-dominant from earliest childhood. There is strong dialect differentiation between (1) the western coastal area including Colombo, (2) the up-country area including Kandy, and (3) the southeastern area including Kirinda and Hambantota. Most of the data I have used in this APiCS contribution, with the exception of a small number of references to Colombo Malay, come from the variety of SLM spoken daily by all generations in Kirinda. This variety is ordinarily referred to by its speakers as Java (""Javanese""). It is the default lect in APiCS. While speakers of the Kirinda variety understand SLM varieties spoken elsewhere on the island, speakers from outside the southeastern region will find some of its vocabulary, functional morphology, and constructions to be unfamiliar or opaque, although rarely to the point of communicative breakdown.","Sri Lankan Malay (SLM) is spoken by approximately 40,000 people.

This intergenerational decline in fluency is less evident in several smaller up-country (highland) communities. By contrast, the Malay residents of the southeastern coastal village of Kirinda, consisting of four hundred families, have thus far experienced no intergenerational decline whatsoever, and are effectively SLM-dominant from earliest childhood. There is strong dialect differentiation between (1) the western coastal area including Colombo, (2) the up-country area including Kandy, and (3) the southeastern area including Kirinda and Hambantota. Most of the data I have used in this <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span> contribution, with the exception of a small number of references to Colombo Malay, come from the variety of SLM spoken daily by all generations in Kirinda. This variety is ordinarily referred to by its speakers as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Java</span> (""Javanese""). It is the default lect<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span>. While speakers of the Kirinda variety understand SLM varieties spoken elsewhere on the island, speakers from outside the southeastern region will find some of its vocabulary, functional morphology, and constructions to be unfamiliar or opaque, although rarely to the point of communicative breakdown.",,1
68,,68,Ambon Malay,"Ambon Malay is spoken in the central and southern Molouccas islands in eastern Indonesia, by about 200,000 native speakers located on the island of Ambon and neighboring islands, as well as in urban locations in the southern Moluccas. In addition, it is widely used as a second language throughout the central and southern Moluccas, by as many as a million speakers. There are also significant communities of speakers of Ambon Malay in Jakarta (the capital of Indonesia) and in the Netherlands (where it is known as Melajoe Sini ‘Malay here’). Ambon Malay is known as Malayu Ambong by its speakers, who often view it as an inferior variety of Indonesian (which is also a language also derived from an older variety of Malay). Since Ambon Malay is seen as a low form of Indonesian, there is wide-scale variation in the language, from a basilectal variant to something closer to Indonesian, but still retaining features of the basilectal variety. This variation is caused by the formality of the domain, the education of the speakers, and the degree to which they identify with the community. There is also variation between the speech of native speakers and second language speakers, who may be influenced by their native languages to varying degrees. Among native speakers, there are two primary variants, one spoken by Muslims, and located mainly on the northern Hitu peninsula of the island, and another spoken by Christians, spoken on the southern Lei Timor peninsula, including the city of Ambon. The description in APiCS is based on both of these variants. The variety spoken in the Netherlands has diverged significantly from the Ambon Malay spoken in the homeland over the past 60 years.","Ambon Malay is spoken in the central and southern Molouccas islands in eastern Indonesia, by about 200,000 native speakers located on the island of Ambon and neighboring islands, as well as in urban locations in the southern Moluccas.

70,,70,Pidgin Hindustani,"Pidgin Hindustani is a medium of inter-ethnic communication in Fiji. Along with Pidgin Fijian (and now more commonly, Fiji English), it has been widely used for informal interactions between indigenous Fijians and Fiji Indians (or Indo-Fijians), and to some extent between Chinese shopkeepers and Fiji Indians. The default lect documented in APiCS is the one spoken by rural Fijians who interact frequently with Fiji Indians. It is based on recordings made in 1983 in villages in the Nadi district of western Viti Levu.

71,,71,Pidgin Hawaiian,"Pidgin Hawaiian is an extinct contact language spoken mainly in the Kingdom of Hawai'i in the last quarter of the 19th century, derived from earlier L2 varieties of Hawaiian. It was the primary means of communication in the sugar industry (primarily between speakers of Hawaiian, English, Chinese, Portuguese, and Japanese) prior to the rise of Hawai'i Pidgin English (the forerunner of Hawai'i Creole, described in APiCS by Viveka Velupillai) in that social context. The growing utility of the Anglophone pidgin eventually restricted Pidgin Hawaiian to interactions involving native speakers of Hawaiian by the second quarter of the 20th century. Because this is an extinct language, lectal boundaries are unclear. However data utilized in the documentation of Pidgin Hawaiian in APiCS reflect clear stylistic differences. Pidgin Hawaiian when used as the medium of court testimony tended to be more formal than the form appearing in newspapers (which more frequently attested salient basilectal features and reflected a much more reduced vocabulary). Since court testimony was much more prolific than other written sources, the representation of Pidgin Hawaiian in APiCS is skewed towards more mesolectal or acrolectal varieties. Newspaper sources on the other hand may have employed basilectal exaggeration, increasing the frequency of distinctive pidgin features. Also the Pidgin Hawaiian spoken when Chinese dominated the immigrant population (before 1890) had certain rare grammatical features generally absent in the later period (between 1890 and 1920).  The default lect in the APiCS representation is the pidgin attested in the 1880s and 1890s in court testimony.","Pidgin Hawaiian is an extinct contact language spoken mainly in the Kingdom of Hawai'i in the last quarter of the 19th century, derived from earlier L2 varieties of Hawaiian.

Older Gurindji people continue to speak traditional Gurindji, often in code-switching with Kriol.

73,,73,Media Lengua,"Media Lengua, a mixed language with mostly Quechua syntax, morphology, phonology, and semantics and Spanish lexical shapes, is or was used in several distinct areas of Ecuador. My own research was mostly focused on the variety used outside of Salcedo (Cotopaxi) and this is the variety primarily cited in APiCS (the default lect). I have also discovered varieties spoken near Saraguro (Loja) and Cañar (Cañar). Subsequently, Jorge Gomez Rendón (Quito) and Jesse Stewart (Manitoba) have been exploring varieties of Media Lengua spoken mostly north of the capital Quito in the province of Imbabura which is referred to as the lect of Imbabura Media Lengua (data Gómez Rendón) in APiCS. Earlier reports suggest that Media Lengua was also spoken in Zámbiza, near Quito. It is hard to generalize across all these communities, but perhaps something like “indigenous Quechua speakers with frequent contacts with the Spanish-speaking world” comes closest. This description now holds for a great many indigenous highland people in Ecuador, and there may be varieties of Media Lengua so far unnoticed. Also speakers will not always openly acknowledge using Media Lengua. This makes it hard to give exact numbers of Media Lengua speakers.  Media Lengua has not been reported outside of Ecuador, e.g. in the Peruvian or Bolivian highlands. However, forms of mixing resembling Media Lengua may be found there in special registers, e.g. bilingual songs. Also, Spanish loans with Quechua suffixes have been incorporated into Amazonian languages such as Cocama-Cocamilla, suggesting a possible earlier Media Lengua-like pidgin in the Upper Amazon basin.","Media Lengua, a mixed language with mostly Quechua syntax, morphology, phonology, and semantics and Spanish lexical shapes, is or was used in several distinct areas of Ecuador.

74,,74,Chinuk Wawa,"Chinuk Wawa or Chinook Jargon was spoken in Oregon, Washington, much of British Columbia, and after the mid-nineteenth century also parts of Idaho, southeastern Alaska and the far northwest of California.

Structurally and lexically it is fairly stable (apart from increasing relexification from English), although few sources capture the complexity of the phonological system with which it was spoken by many Native Americans and maybe some others. Hale (1890) documents much of the lexicon; the texts in Jacobs 1936 not collected from Victoria Howard and also Boas (1933) represent some of the narratives produced.
