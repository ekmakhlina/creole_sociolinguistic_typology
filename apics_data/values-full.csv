Writing as one word sometimes seems to indicate dependency. E.g., when followed by no, the sequence is sometimes written as one word, not only with a=no [3SG.SBJ=NEG], but also with mi=no [1SG=NEG] (Van Dyk c1765). At least once, 1SG mi is written together with the verb it is the object of.

By contrast, dependent object pronouns are uncertain. Attested as indirect object: 2SG -u (vs. yu) dependent indirect object of gi 'give' (not attested with other verbs). 
Perhaps reduced variants of pronouns did occur as dependent direct object but were not differentiated from the full forms in the writing.

Ghanaian Pidgin English’s tense system conforms to Bickerton’s Creole prototype only as far as absolute tense is concerned, i.e. when a situation is located on the time axis relative to the moment of speaking: unmarked state verbs can express nonpast and unmarked action verbs past. However, when it comes to relative tense, which locates a situation not in relation to the time of speaking but in relation to another moment on the time axis (anteriority), Ghanaian Pidgin English departs from the creole prototype. Bickerton (1980: 5)says that an anterior tense marker be present to signal past for state verbs and past-before-past for action verbs. Ghanaian Pidgin English does not have such an anterior tense marker (which takes the form bìn in Krio, NigPE, and CamPE). Therefore, unmarked verbs may also refer to an anterior situation. Note that the anterior interpretation of such sentences is entirely dependent on co(n)textual clues or time adverbials, which may optionally be inserted for disambiguation. In sum, then, a distinction between Ghanaian Pidgin English stative and active verbs cannot be made on the grounds of temporal reference of unmarked verbs: both types of verbs may refer to anterior or non-anterior situations when unmarked.

2-4-2,2,4,2,4-2,"As Nickel & Wilner (1984: 40) note, location phrases are formed with the locational preposition na, which may then be followed by another locational marker such as ondro ‘under’, ini ‘in’, tapu ‘top’, etc. (cf. examples 12 and 15). The latter items can also be used independently of na. Na used by itself simply marks location or a goal, as in:

Mi de na mi mama oso. 
[1SG be.at LOC 1SG mother house]
‘I’m at my mother’s house.'

Mi e go na mi mama oso. 
[1SG IPFV go LOC 1SG mother house]
‘I’m going to my mother’s house.’ (Wilner 1992: 47)

Locational markers such as ini and ondro may either precede the noun, in which case they seem to function like prepositions, or follow the noun, in which case they are like nominalizations.

As such it is close in function and grammaticalization status to a definite article; however it is not used obligatorily in all ""definite"" contexts, but only if the identification of the referent is actually at stake and/or the referent is topical. The recognitional determiner also occurs with generic NPs (see Feature 30 ""Generic noun phrases in subject function"") and inherently definite NPs such as proper names.

With respect to this feature, the temporal implications of such a categorisation merit some further comment:

From a morphological point of view, finite Diu Indo-Portuguese verbs only code a twofold distinction (e.g. fik 'stay, dwell, become' vs. fik-o 'stayed, dwelt, became'; kõp 'buy' vs. kõpr-o 'bought'). One category consistently and obligatorily constructs past reference, and as such it is classified as 'Past'; the remaining forms participate in the expression of various temporal-aspectual combinations (from present habitual to immediate future) which, from a temporal point of view, can only be unified as 'not making explicit reference to the Past', hence the classification as 'non-Past' [Verbal morphology does not license any comparable Future category, and future reference requires a preverbal particle a(d)]. 

Having clarified the temporal categories which are relevant for Diu Indo-Portuguese, we can now compare the actual temporal value of unmarked stative and dynamic verbs. They do not differ fundamentally, in that none has Past reference. Finer differences between them (e.g. whether or not they make reference to the moment of utterance) derive from their different semantics. Crucially, the habitual reading of both unmarked stative and dynamic verbs can be described as ""present habitual"" (as opposed to ""past habitual"", which has a different expression in the language).",221,39-167 39-32,100.0,Very certain,"{""_number_of_values"": 1, ""icon"": ""pie-100-0000FF.png""}",

Tense is responsible for suppletive alternations (e.g. vẽy 'come.NPST.PFV' vs. vey 'come.PST.PFV'). The fact that these forms simultaneously contribute temporal and aspectual information should not mislead us, though. As a matter of fact, all finite verb forms in Diu Indo-Portuguese have a Perfective reading (i.e. Imperfectivity is not coded morphologically) and, as such, suppletive alternations rest solely on Tense alternations. On the contrary, Imperfective marking resorts to auxiliaries preposed to the nonfinite form of the main verb. There are two imperfective auxiliaries, te/tə and tiŋ, non-Past and Past respectively; these, however, are verbal in nature, so the alternation observed is, once again, motivated by Tense. 

The only cases in which one might recognize suppletion according to Aspect involve suppletive alternation between finite verb forms and their nonfinite counterparts, in the sense that the former are laden with aspectual information whereas the latter are neutral in that respect. In Diu Indo-Portuguese, this type of suppletive alternation obtains only for one verb: ir 'go.INF' vs. vay 'go.NPST.PFV' vs. foy 'go.PST.PFV'. However, I have decided to disregard this instance because ir is a highly acrolectal form, taken directly from Standard Portuguese and used only by a small section of the speech community in very particular social contexts; the regular nonfinite form of this particular verb is, in fact, equivalent to the non-Past finite form: vay.",221,39-103 39-104 39-105,100.0,Very certain,"{""icon"": ""pie-100-0000FF.png"", ""wals_value_number"": 1}",

39-90-2,39,90,2,90-2,"At present, the issue of whether Diu Indo-Portuguese contains a formal passivization strategy is not sufficiently worked out. On the one hand, it is clear that, given the language's inclination for elision, the most productive means to demote a particular argument which is deemed non-essential to the speech act is simply not to produce it. [If the agent subject of a transitive verb is ellided, the object may either occur post-verbally (the prototypical object position) or pre-verbally, which does not impair proper parsing of the sentence in the sense that context will normally clarify the role of the expressed constituent.]

Attempts to elicit passive constructions, particularly those with an overt agent, met with hesitation and inconsistent output: most speakers produced a regular active sentence, while others produced constructions approaching the Standard Portuguese passive (i.e. auxiliary ser 'to be' + past participle, agent expressed in a prepositional phrase with por 'by'), consisting of a participle form preceded by a form of either the copula te or the verb vay 'to go', with the agent expressed in a prepositional phrase with prepositions pə or də. If anything, this exercise highlights the fact that speakers of Diu Indo-Portuguese do not make regular use of a passivization strategy allowing the agent to be expressed, and when pressed look towards Standard Portuguese for a model.

The spoken corpus does contain a number of instances of participles preceded by either a form of the copula/auxiliary te or the verb fika 'to become', which have been proposed as likely candidates for passive constructions. However, none of these has an exclusively passive use, and it remains to be ascertained whether or not they construct passive meaning at all. Therefore, even though I suspect none of these constructions should be interpreted as a passive construction, I admit further research may prove otherwise.",221,,100.0,Intermediate,"{""_number_of_values"": 1, ""icon"": ""pie-100-FFFFFF.png""}",

4-4-2,4,4,2,4-2,"The language has very few prepositions. They are 
(n)a, which marks general location, fu, which marks possession, and gi, which introduces a range of semantic roles such as recipient, beneficiary, experiencer etc. (note that gi developed from a serial verb; see Migge 1998). (N)a subcategorizes for an NP consisting either of a location-denoting noun (na + NP [DET N]), e.g.

Mi de na a kantoo.
I COP LOC DET.SG office
'I'm at the office.'

 or a location-denoting noun that is in a possessive relationship with a small set of locational nouns (na NP [NP N(+LOC)], e.g.

a buku de na a tafaa ondoo.
DET.SG book COP LOC DET.SG table under.side
'The book is under the table.'

Some of these locational nouns may also function as prepositions together with (n)a N(+LOC) NP, e.g.

a ini a osu (ini)
LOC inside DEF house (inside)
'in the house.'

(N)a is the general locative preposition while ini, tapu etc. are locative nouns. A ini together can be translated as 'in' in English but the literal translation would be more accurately rendered as 'at-inside'. These locational nouns/prepositions are undergoing change; they are nouns that specify location but they are also moved from the phrase final position to the position just behind the general locational preposition na. It is unclear how to classify them then; in Sranan the change has gone so far that na is then omitted entirely giving rise to constructions where these items function simply as a preposition. E.g. skrifi en tapu a pampira 'write it on the paper' instead of sikrifi en na a papira tapu. This change in progress is probably propelled by contact with Dutch in the case of Sranan and contact with Sranan and Dutch in the case of Nengee. See Bryun, Adrienne. 1995.

Sab can also appear with the present-tense marker, as in 
(b)
Yo tə sab.

In the past, sab is conjugated as expected, i.e. sabew 'found out, came to know'. Note that the semantic interpretation of sabew expresses the beginning of knowing. That is, it has an inchoative interpretation.

Unmarked, kere 'want, need' has present-tense interpretation.
(c)
Pari ag kere.
[me water want]
'I want/need water.'

The past-tense form of kere (i.e. keri) is not heard much. The form kere is used in past contexts as well. 

Other stative verbs, such as siti 'feel' behave like dynamic verbs in terms of their marking. Thus, examples (d-e) are completely acceptable.

(d)
Pari friw siti-n.

'I'm feeling cold.'

(e)

47-120-2,47,120,2,120-2,"Birmingham (1970: 4ff) describes the relevance of pitch to disyllabic verbs. He notes that the first syllable of such verbs is characterized by falling pitch, the second by rising pitch (p.5). He also points to some disyllabic forms of other parts of speech which display this pitch pattern (p.6), and concludes that ""pitch has taken the place of stress in these instances"" (6). He assumes that pitch has no relevance to other words in Papiamentu. In fact, those other words are characterized by the coincidence of pitch and accent (Kouwenberg & Murray 1994). What Birmingham noted was the non-coincidence of pitch and accent in the bisyllabic verbs, where accent on the first syllable normally coincides with a phonologically Low tone, whereas the unaccented final syllable carries a High tone. Only a handful of bisyllabic verbs, of Dutch and English origin, display a HL melody with penultimate stress, e.g., sunchi 'kiss', wèlder 'weld', fretu 'stuff, gorge (on food)', fangu 'catch'.
Römer (1977) and subsequent work, collected in Römer (1991), attempts a more complete description of tone in Papiamentu. Kouwenberg (2004) argues that tone melody is largely predictable from word class and that Papiamentu is best considered a pitch-accent language, where pitch and accent normally coincide.",1298;748;1275;731,47-236,100.0,Very certain,"{""icon"": ""pie-100-FFFF00.png"", ""wals_value_number"": 2}",

The postpositional possessive uses su, which is also the 3rd person singular possessive pronoun. Although full NP possessors are inherently 3rd person, the occurrence of su with both singular and plural possessors shows that it has no number features.
Moreover, the occasional use of non-3rd person plural pronouns in the possessor position of this construction (e.g. boso tur su trabou [2PL all 3SG.POSS work] 'the work of all of you', Maurer 1988: 38) shows that su is essentially a marker of the possessive relationship, and has no pronominal features whatsoever – it is a postposition.

If that analysis is on the right track, lo is not relevant here, and the possible content of the preverbal Mood position needs to be reconsidered altogether. A further consequence of that analysis is that Papiamentu does not, in fact, differ from other creole languages in that it conforms to the protypical preverbal Tense-Mood-Aspect order, with Mood possibly being expressed by pa, normally translated as 'for', but with modal implications.
Here, acknowledging the fact that this analysis is as yet preliminary and needs to be supported by further work, I have followed more traditional scholarship, which treats lo as a preverbal mood marker in an unusual peripheral position. This means that the order of elements is:

47-46-4,47,46,4,46-4,"While some authors have treated preverbal ta as an imperfective or progressive marker, it is in fact not associated with any particular aspectual interpretation. Instead, the Aktionsart of the predicate and the presence of other material such as adverbial modifiers combine to determine the aspectual interpretation (see for instance the lengthy discussion in Muller 1989: 228–253). The presence of ta does not add to this interpretation. It should be noted also that ta is fully compatible with the majority of stative verbs, and that it fails to induce a change from a stative to a progressive or inchoative reading, as might be expected if it were a progressive marker. This is illustrated here. Moreover, it is compatible with aspectual interpretations (progressive, habitual) as well as non-aspectual interpretations (future, generic).
Based on all this, Kouwenberg & Lefebvre (2007) argue that ta is a dummy tense marker. Maurer (1988) has suggested that it marks ""same tense"", on the basis of its acceptability in past contexts. More recently, he has argued that ta (with a very restricted allomorph zero) is on its way to grammaticalize into a Indo-European-like present tense.

47-49-3,47,49,3,49-3,"Most descriptions agree that the set of preverbal markers includes lo, ta, a, and tabata, but there is no agreement on their interpretation. Nonetheless, it seems safe to say that Papiamentu does not have a purely temporal system, in that at least one marker, tabata, is clearly a tense-aspect marker: It combines tense reference (past or anterior) with an aspect interpretation (imperfective) (Goilo 1953, Muller 1989, Andersen 1990, Birmingham 1970, Kouwenberg 2007)-although it may be more accurate to say that it marks non-perfective past rather than a true imperfective.
Most authors characterize a as marking a (tense-neutral) perfective. In contrast, Maurer (1988a) characterizes a, like tabata, as [+anterior], distinguished from tabata as perfective, and suggesting that these forms should be constrained to similar tense reference.
The more peripherally placed marker lo has been described as a future tense marker (Birmingham 1970), a posterior tense marker (Maurer 1988a), an Irrealis Mood marker (Kouwenberg 2007), and a Finite Mood marker (Kouwenberg & Lefebvre 2007).

There are no verbs which fail to combine with the other preverbal modifiers. Thus we can distinguish three sets of verbs:
a. stative verbs which do not combine with ta, e.g., konosé 'know, be acquainted with', sabi ~ sa 'know', ke (Curacao) and kjèr (Aruba) (both: 'want');
b. stative verbs which are optionally modified by ta, e.g., stima 'love', kosta 'cost';

Maurer (1988: 259ff) describes the same phenomenon, but also includes an example where the first verb is marked by the preverbal nonperfective past marker tabata, the second by gerundive ta.
There are two problems, however, in assessing these cases:
First, they almost always involve complete overlap of the events denoted by the two verbs in sequence.
Secondly, and related to the first issue, the second event is usually a gerundial which marks manner or circumstance.

(iii) a body reflexive consisting of a possessive pronoun + kurpa 'body'; this is restricted to verbs denoting physical action, where it is often ambiguous between a reflexive interpretation and a literal interpretation, and a few idioms (e.g., yuda su kurpa [help POSS body] 'help oneself').
Where the pronoun + kurpa strategy can be used, the pronoun + mes strategy is equally acceptable, but the reverse situation does not hold, showing pronoun + mes to be the main reflexive form.

Birmingham (1970: 69) points out that some reflexive constructions in Spanish correspond to non-reflexives in Papiamentu, e.g. Spanish se vistió [REFL dressed] compares to Papiamento el a bisti paña [3SG PFV wear clothes], both 'he dressed'.",151[69ff],47-165 47-166 47-167 47-169,87.5,Very certain,"{""_number_of_values"": 2, ""icon"": ""pie-13-FF0000-88-FFFF00.png""}",

In fact, Birmingham also points out that Papiamentu ""tends to use the definite article far less than do the Hispanic languages"" (1970: 41f), and provides an overview of contexts where a definite article would normally be expected to occur in Spanish, but not in Papiamentu.

Instead of a passive construction, an impersonal construction can be used: It contains a null subject which can be considered to have arbitrary reference.
Alternatively, an active construction can be used with a pronominal subject nan [3PL], which receives arbitrary interpretation. And finally, a construction using keda 'remain, stay' as auxiliary can also express passive meaning.
The passive construction is not frequent, and it is probably safe to say that many speakers consider it somewhat formal. For instance, Maduro (1971: 16) ""corrects"" the passive Rei Pablo a ser enterá [king Pablo PFV PASS buried] 'King Pablo has been buried' to an active construction Nan a dera rei Pablo [3PL PFV bury king Pablo] (same meaning).

We thus have:
ese akí (close)
ese aí (there)
ese aké (further removed)

Also, and this is important given the high frequency of aki and aí (two adverbs meaning 'here' and 'there' (cp. Span. aquí/allí), the two major locative adverbs have built in demonstrative meaning. Witness:

akí kasa 'in the (here) house'
aí kasa 'in the (there) house'

esta casa
esa casa

Akí kasa ta asé kaló.
'In this house it is hot.'

In my view, much about the Palenquero verb phrase is poorly understood, and therefore in need of serious reanalysis. Part of the difficulty in analyzing the Palenquero verb phrase is that we are not sure how certain key mood and aspect particles should be segmented. For instance:

atá vs. a-tá (PROG)

The common progressive marker ta is not generally used with stative verbs (thus *i ta kelé bae 'I want to go' is always rendered as i kelé bae).

Particularly troublesome in terms of analysis is the presence of the preverbal element a- (which may or may not have morphemic status, as its function or role is unclear). Schwegler & Green (2007: 275) make this point about it in the section on Statives without past reference (slightly edited here to bring it in line with bibliographic and other practices of this Atlas):

Statives with non-past reference are expressed in two ways: (a) with the bare verb stem ( __ + V), or (b) with a + the bare verb stem (a + V). 
	Patiño (1983: 123) believes that the preverbal particle a in a + V is devoid of any semantic function, and that constructions (a) and (b) are, therefore, in free alternation (cf. [1] to [2] below, where polé and a polé appear to have identical meanings). To date, no plausible alternative explanation has been offered, but the suspicion persists that this a does hold a hitherto unidentified function (see now Moñino 1999).

It has been argued (e.g.Patiño (1983: 122), Dieck (2002)) that predicate negation structures, relative clauses, and a few other environments strongly favour the omission of preverbal a. My own corpus attests to a similar behavior of a in these environments. The correlation between morphosyntactic environment and presence or absence of certain preverbal markers has only heightened our suspicion that a indeed carries a yet unidentified functional role.",1359[275ss];979[n/a],48-1 48-34 48-38 48-81 48-82 48-90 48-91,100.0,Intermediate,"{""_number_of_values"": 1, ""icon"": ""pie-100-FFFF00.png""}",
48-48-2,48,48,2,48-2,"There are two commonly used habitual markers in Palenquero: asé (past: asé-ba) and sabé (past: sabé-ba or a-sabé-ba). There are derived from Spanish hacer and saber, respectively, both of which held habitual functions in earlier dialectal Spanish (the case of saber is documented, the one of hacer is not, but can be deduced by evidence from the Chota Valley of Highland Ecuador).

Preverbal [asé] or sabé, the latter being a far less frequent though not uncommon marker, are used to express habitual aspect. Habitual aspect is, however, often simply implied, i.e. not expressed overtly by [asé] or sabé.
	Graphic representation of the habitual marker [asé] is the subject of some dispute, which is why we have represented it here in phonetic transcription. Some authors view it as a bi-partite, bi-morphemic element (a-sé or a se rather than asé; cp. Patiño (1983: 118, ex. 33)), but those who favour that analysis have never made clear what the function/meaning of the initial a- would be.

 Cases of habitual [se] (rather than [asé] are readily attested, but this variation may at times simply be due to a (substrate-driven?)

Maurer also points to the fact that in Bantu languages, stative verbs referring to present events cannot be marked by present tense, but must be marked by the perfect marker (see also Lingala and Mixed Ma'a/Mbugu in this database). This could explain why stative verbs referring to present situations and dynamic verbs referring to past perfective situations are both marked with a in Palenquero, although optionally.

See also Fattier (1996: 214) on zot forms cited by various authors. This form may have the value 2PL or 3PL:

2PL: In the description of Comhaire-Sylvain ([1936] 1979: 61), we find two examples: 
zòt fini 'Have you (pl) finished?';
M’a boulé zòt 'I will burn you (pl).'
Comhaire-Sylvain writes (p. 61): ""The use of zòt for the second person plural can be found in certain areas in the South of Haiti, especially in the area around Les Cayes; it prevents any confusion between the first and the second person plural.""

3PL: Comhaire-Sylvain (p. 62) gives the following example: 
L’a-pòté-l ba zòt 'He will take it to them.'
She further writes: ""This use of zòt as pronoun complement of the third person plural is in the process of dying out; it can only still be found in the speech of a few farmers in the north.""

The map in the ""Atlas linguistique d’Haïti"" presented in my thesis (Fattier 1998) and dedicated to this question shows that the zòt pronominal forms are known (but they are not spontaneously used during the survey) as a second person pronoun (2PL) in Limbé (in the north of Haiti) and as a third person pronoun in Ganthier (in the south of Haiti).

The language doesn’t need it at all.” (our translation)",,49-293 49-294,25.0,Very certain,"{""_number_of_values"": 2, ""icon"": ""pie-25-0000FF-75-FFFFFF.png""}",Own knowledge

(This distinction has been lost in all other French Creoles. Its retention in Mauritian Creole is probably to be associated with massive Indian immigration in the 19th century - people whose languages have two or more 2nd person singular forms for use with people of differing status.) In later visits from 1970 onwards, pro-drop was observed with other persons and numbers.

(a) For singular and plural nouns: 
Mókó ('one') and mosúsu ('other') may be used to determine a noun whose referent is indefinite-specific, i.e. the speaker has a specific referent in mind but wishes to keep it undefined. In this usage type, mókó and mosúsu are used with singular as well as plural nouns and always remain invariable. 

molakisi mókó 'some/a teacher'
milakisi mókó 'some teachers'
lopángo mókó ‘some/a compound’
mapángo mókó ‘some compounds’

molakisi mosúsu ‘some teacher’
milakisi mosúsu ‘some teachers’
lopángo mosúsu ‘some compound’
mapángo mosúsu ‘some compounds’

(b) For plural nouns: 
(i) see the uses of mókó and mosúsu above
(ii) The prefix ba- occurs quite frequently as a supplementary prefix. It may be added to both singular and plural nouns, except to nouns in classes 2 and 10, whose primary prefix is already ba- (thus avoiding *ba-ba-). The meaning distinction between on the one hand a noun’s “regular” plural (i.e. formed by changing the primary prefix) and, on the other, its plural produced by adding ba- to its singular or plural form, is the following. The regular plural is used when the referent is indefinite and nonspecific. Informants unanimously respond that supplementary ba- is excluded in such usage types. Supplementary ba- is used when the referent is indefinite-specific or definite. The first sentence below, using the word likásá ('leaf', regular plural makásá) is an example of an indefinite nonspecific referent, the second of an indefinite-specific one, and the third of a definite one.

On a dynamic verb it denotes perfect: the action is carried out in the past and has led to a resulting situation in the present. Important to note is that, in the case of dynamic verbs, the past action is backgrounded and the present situation foregrounded, not the other way around (see Brisard & Meeuwis 2009).

60-90-1,60,90,1,90-1,"In addition to the typical passive construction, exemplified in 60-126, Lingala speakers have three other constructions at their disposal to express passiveness. 

One is the so-called 'agentless passive' (also called 'stative', 'neute', and 'passive-active'). The form is neither passive nor active: in contrast to actives, the grammatical subject is not the agent, and, in contrast to passives, no agent can be explicated or is implied. In other words, the speaker conveys that the subject is affected by the action, but ignores the involvement of an agent.

O-yéb-án-í
[2SG-know-NEUT-PRES1]
‘You are known’

A second one is the non-promotional passive, which leaves the verb in the active voice, followed by the original patient complement; replaces the subject marker with the 3PL.AN marker having impersonal or generic reference ('they', 'people'); and identifies the agent in the same way as is done in the typical passive construction, i.e. by means of a prepositional phrase with na.

Ba-ko-fíng-a ngáí na molakisi
[3PL.AN-FUT-insult-FV 1SG by teacher]
'I will be insulted by the teacher'.

A third construction consists in the combination of the (preradical) reflexive marker -mí- and the (postradical) causative marker -is-. In some contexts this combination conveys, as might be predicated, that the subject referent causes him- or herself to perform the action referred to by the verb root. But in other contexts it concomitantly generates a causative and a passive meaning. Thus, in the example below, the subject referent will not cause himself to insult (someone), but will cause himself to be insulted. In comparison with the typical passive, this construction stresses the responsibility of the subject referent in causing the situation he or she undergoes as patient.

All nouns fall into one of the noun classes, and in that sense all nouns are marked for number. One could argue, however, that number as such is not a category that is grammatically relevant for Bantu languages such as Mbugu since there is no grammatical rule that refers to plural or singular. In general there is little doubt for noun tokens whether they are singular or plural, as in Indo-European languages.

As regards the syntax, the subject of the active is often omitted; otherwise, it is placed in a peripheral position in comparison with the patient, which occupies the subject position when an agent is specified or when the passive is followed by a secondary verb (accusative phrase). In the case of impersonal or habitual phrases without agent the patient occupies a direct object position and follows the verb (ergative phrase).

This process is only occasionally found in etymologically Cree words, as in pikwawna / piko ana 'anybody'. The alternation between labialized velars and plain velars preceded by a back vowel is found in many Algonquian languages. 
(2) In some cases /kw/ and /k/ are pronunciation variants, as one hears both kwasee and korsee 'girdle', kwarnee, kornee. 
(3) Forms like chwizin for 'kitchen', in which the original /k/ is palatalized, suggest that /kw/ is a unit, as the velar is affected by a palatalization process under the influence of the high front vowel.

However, Stefánsson's (1909) indication of length by a line above vowels, as in īla 'he, she, it', is not consistent, neither in his notation of pidgin forms nor in the Eskimo forms in his etymological explanations. The same can be said about consonant length, which is indicated by consonant doubling. Probably, the notation of length in the pidgin refers to quality rather than quantity, e.g. a 'long' [i] vs. a 'short' [ɪ]. Since the Eskimo pidgins are extinct, it is difficult to verify whether such quality differences correspond to phonemic distinctions. In Eskimo proper they do not, whereas length does. It is likely that Inuit distinguished length in their pronunciation of pidgin words of Eskimo origin. It is more difficult to say something about the pronunciation by the non-Inuit outsiders, who formed a very heterogeneous group, with regard to linguistic background. In the questionnaire examples I have maintained the original transcription from the sources.
